## Word Counter App

### Lab #2
- You will need to use „Android Studio” IDE in order to create application which will count text metrics such as sentences, words, characters and numbers in the entered text. Application should meet the following requirements:
    - Variables, functions and other elements should have meaningful names (e.g. txtName  vs EditText1)
    - Code should follow Java coding standards;
    - Text should be entered into TextEdit element.
    - Spinner element might be used to define what to count:
            a.	Sentences;
            b.	Words;
            c.	Chars;
            d.	Numbers;
    - Counting might be done when Button element is clicked;
    - Results should be shown in the TextView element;
    - Metrics counting should not be executed in the main Activity i.e. use separate class(es) in separate *.java file(s) for that.
    - Two metrics should be counted by using regular expressions others not using.
    - Words in the entered text can be separated by spaces, commas or dots;
    - Text (Label) for GUI elements should be taken from strings resource file.
    - Application should validate the entered text (if string is not empty). If the string is empty, then warning should be shown by using Toast element;
